Seasoned KiCad users are familiar with the venerable 3DViewer tool
which has traditionally been used to help verify design by visual
inspection and to create images of what a project may look like
when it is finished. Historically the 3DViewer could only process
a very limited implementation of the VRML2 (aka VRML97) specification
as produced by the Wings3D modeler. In the past two years various
developers contributed support for VRML1 and a very limited
implementation of X3D. Although this gave users greater freedom,
users remained unable to exploit the IGES and STEP mechanical models
of components as provided by many manufacturers and retailers. The
ability to view such mechanical models within KiCad would give users
access to a much larger collection of models on the internet;
furthermore IGES and STEP mechanical models can eventually be used
by KiCad to provide a direct export of solid model files for use
by mechanical designers and hobbyists. With the intention of eventual
support for direct mechanical model export as outlined long ago in
CERN's KiCad roadmap
(http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cern-kicad/wiki/WorkPackages#20-Improved-3D-model-support),
a 3D Plugin system was developed to make it easier to support
arbitrary
3D model formats in the future. After almost 8 months in development
the code branch is now ready for testing by users and developers;
the KiCad branch is available for installation from nightly builds:

http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/osx/testing/3d_initial_merge/

For other systems, the source code is available at
https://code.launchpad.net/~cirilo-bernardo/kicad/3d_initial_merge

The code branch contains the plugin system with plugins to support
IDF files (emn + emp), IDF component outlines (idf), VRML1, VRML2,
and X3D. A plugin is available to view IGES and STEP files via
OpenCASCADE Community Edition (OCE):

The code today gives users a view of what's to come. At the moment
the 3DViewer cannot handle the new data formats used to visualize
the models so models other than X3D, VRML1, and VRML2 will only be
visible within the 3D File Browser. A new 3DViewer is under
development which can take advantage of the new 3D plugin system
and will eventually replace the legacy 3DViewer:
